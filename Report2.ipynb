    "# Introduction\n",
    " \n",
    "Interpreter Scheduling Problems (ISP) are increasingly relevant in today’s globalized and multicultural society. These problems arise in various critical domains such as healthcare, legal systems, and international or urban institutional meetings, where multilingual communication is essential for effective interaction. Poor scheduling or mismanagement of interpreters can lead to serious consequences: for example, a patient might be unable to accurately describe their symptoms during a medical consultation, potentially endangering their life. In legal or political contexts, miscommunication due to interpreter shortages or mismatches can result in misunderstandings, delays, or even violations of fundamental rights.\n",
    " \n",
    "Effective interpreter scheduling is a complex task that must balance interpreter availability, language coverage, fairness of workload distribution, and institutional constraints. Unlike automated translation systems which are not yet 100% reliable and often fail to capture nuance in real-time spoken interaction human to interpreters remain essential in high-stakes or sensitive environments. Thus, the goal is to develop robust schedules that maximize language pair coverage while also being flexible enough to handle unforeseen events such as sudden changes in availability or last-minute session modifications.\n",
    " \n",
    "Several research papers have addressed interpreter scheduling problems by proposing various mathematical and algorithmic approaches, including integer programming, stochastic modeling, and heuristic optimization.\n",
    " \n",
    "In this work, our objective is to explore and solve a realistic Interpreters Scheduling Problem (ISP). The setting involves a group of interpreters working for an institution, each proficient in a specific set of languages. These interpreters must be assigned to various sessions (grouped in blocks), where speakers communicate exclusively in their native languages. Interpreters are essential to ensure mutual understanding between participants. The main goal is to maximize the coverage of language pairs across all sessions, while respecting a range of logical and operational constraints. Additionally, we investigate advanced mechanisms such as bridging, which allows interpreters to indirectly connect languages through a shared intermediary."
